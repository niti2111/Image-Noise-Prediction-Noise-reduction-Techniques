 Noise Classification Using CNNs

This repository contains a comprehensive project that combines research and implementation to tackle the challenge of image noise classification. It includes:

	•	Research Paper: A detailed study outlining the methodology, dataset, CNN model, and evaluation metrics used for noise classification.

Abstract

In digital imaging, image noise is a prevalent problem that deteriorates the clarity and interpretability of visual data. This research proposes a method to categorize various types of noise in images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The study examines five main noise types: Gaussian, Poisson, Speckle, Shot, and Quantization, utilizing a labeled dataset generated from noise-free images.

The CNN model was developed from scratch to extract discriminative features for accurate classification. Evaluation metrics like Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Mean Squared Error (MSE), F1-score, Precision, and Recall demonstrate the model’s high classification accuracy and robustness. This work provides valuable insights for image denoising and quality assessment applications.
